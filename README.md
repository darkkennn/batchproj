Hello Batch Team, 

This is my assignment that was handed to me on 1st of June. This assignment is still somewhat incomplete due to my ongoing end semester examinations but I promise for it to be done by 1-2 more days.

In this project I've only focused on using HTML and css as instructed and tried my best to replicate the figma design. I am a react dev who uses tailwind for css so my pure HTML CSS basics are a little washed but I thought this would be a good challenge so,
so here I present to you, Batch-uiFry. 

The font was missing so I tried to custom add the font but it didn't seem to work that well. I have yet to align the download button to the navbar and so many more fixes, but I had an exam today so I didn't have much time to complete it. I'm submitting this
incomplete project because of deadlines that are approaching but I hope I get a day more to make all the fixes and changes.

Lastly,
I hope you like this replica project and grant me the opportunity to learn under you.
